How To Build The Project
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Bilbo Blogger is based on KBlog library! And you could build it with KBlog. (But with some modifications on code!) and With KBlog you may misses some features that didn't commited to KBlog source code yet!

So we have a modified version of KBlog for Bilbo called "BilboKBlog", And you can build Bilbo with it, (Current source is intended to build with BilboKBlog)

You have to build and install BilboKBlog before building Bilbo, if you didn't install it yet!
cd bilbo
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix` ..
make
sudo make install OR su -c 'make install'

to uninstall the project:
make uninstall or su -c 'make uninstall'
